    <p>Hola a todos. I want tell you something about me. I'm married with a wonderful woman (Claudia) and we was sealed in
         the Mexico City Temple on October 30, 2004. We have 2 sons Jared 16 years old and Abraham 13 years old. I currently
         live in La Paz, Baja California Sur Mexico (it is a city north of Los Cabos), but i Born on November 11, 1974
         in the Mexico City. </p>
    <p>This month I celebrate 23 years as a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-days saints. Honestly these years
        were been the best on my life, and the gospel helped me to develop myself in a better person and Jesus Christ disciple.</p>
    <p>I have a bachelor degree in accounting and a MBA. Currently I'm unemployed, but I was worked for many years as 
        operations manager in the automotive and insurance industry. Although my academic preparation was been in the
         administrative areas, I love the technology and have some experience in web development with Wordpress support.</p>
    <p>I am very excited with it new experience, really i hope that it will help me to develop my career and
         obtain a better job.</p>
