                <h2>Seguridad Vial MX</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a personal effort to collaborate in the development of an adequate road culture in Mexico, with the sole purpose of achieving a better coexistence on the streets between motor vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks, etc.), cyclists and pedestrians, and so on. contribute to the reduction of road accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is my grain of sand for achieving a change of mentality in people, companies and government, in order to move towards a better road culture and if this helps to save at least one life, all the time, money and effort invested will be worth it the sorrow.

                <h2>Logistics coordinator of the Pope Francisco visit to México</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2016 I was in charge of coordinating the transportation logistics of the fleet assigned to transport Pope Francis and his entourage during his visit to Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I coordinated times and movements of units in conjunction with the presidential staff, I made sure that the carrier complied with the logistics and the assigned times. Additionally, I led the maintenance team in charge of ensuring the cleanliness and good condition of each of the units.

                <h2>Employee benefits program restructuring and cost reduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I directed a review of policies for assigning vehicles to personnel with the goal of better balancing each of the expenses generated by the area. Thanks to this, a substantial reduction in fixed area costs of more than 2 million dollars per year was achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In parallel, an agreement was negotiated with the finance secretary of the state of Coahuila Mexico so that the company would have the capacity to carry out the registration of units (registration of license plates) autonomously. This made it possible to reduce unit documentation times by 75%.

                <h2>Automation and digitization finance area processes</h2>
                <p>
                    I commanded a multidisciplinary team (IT, finance, legal, logistics, etc.), with the aim of reengineering each of the area's processes, focused on streamlining and modernizing each of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Derived from this work, the development of an own system was achieved that allowed the digitization of each of the documents, as well as a total mapping of each of the stages of the process. Thanks to this, savings and better distribution of workloads were achieved (savings of approximately 2,500 man hours) and at the same time, improving the quality of the service provided (the service satisfaction KPI improved by 20%).
